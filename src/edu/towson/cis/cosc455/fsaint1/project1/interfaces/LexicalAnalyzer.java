 * COSC 455 Programming Languages: Implementation and Design.
 *
 * A Simple Lexical Analyzer adapted from Sebesta (2010) by Josh Dehlinger,
 * modified by Adam Conover (2012) and interfaced by Josh Dehlinger (2013)
 *
 * Note that these are not the only methods necessary to implement the  
 * lexical analyzer. You will likely need to add new methods to your implementaion
 * of this interface. 
 * 
 * 
 * my notes
 * 
 * so get tokens broken up by spaces
 * check first character if it's in symbols
 * then it's a lexeme
 * then check if it's in lexemes
 * if not generate error
